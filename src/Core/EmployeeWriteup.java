 * The message is an employee write-up/disciplinary note. This is largely 
 * like the employee evaluation, and, in fact, works largely like an 
 * evaluation. The difference is that employee writeups are counted against
 * the employee and if they go past a particular threshold, they initiate
 * a disciplinary message to be sent to the managers/supervisors responsible
 * for that employee.
