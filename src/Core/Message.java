 * A message is the Core scheduling and synchronization primitive. It is the 
 * basis of the strategy system, and controls many parts of the daily running
 * and quality of life  for users of the system. A message can be sent synchronously
 * (have an object waiting for it to be processed) or asynchronously (the message
 * is basically standalone and nothing is waiting for it to get done with). 
 * This replaces the schedule/activity conglomerate from the original Wizard 
 * system, and should provide extra stability, flexibility, and accountability, 
 * than they do.
